motadble
========

### Prerequisites
* Python 2.6+
* python-virtualenv
* python-pip


### About
Motdable allows you to manage and execute Ansible (http://www.ansibleworks.com/) playbooks. 


It was written on a Sunday, in the spirit of NFL games; so I elected to think of Playbooks 
as "Play Calls" and hosts as "Players". The interface where you choose the player and call 
to execute is called the "Coordinator".

  ```
  git clone <repo> $application_root 
  ```

0. create virtual enviroment

  ```
  virtualenv --no-site-packages $application_root/venv
  ```
