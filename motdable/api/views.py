    Playbooks are Scripted Plays (aka Ansible Playbooks) that the Coordinator
    executes against a Host.
    
    Each Playbook consists of a title used to reference it, and content
    which must represent a valid yaml ansible playbook.

    You may additionally pass variables to playbooks via PlaybookVariables .
    See the playbookvars endpoint in our Api Root for management.
      
    NOTE:  
      The ansible playbook MUST use $host_group as its hosts: variable; e.g.
      ---
      - hosts: $host_group
